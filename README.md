# WaterPotability
Water plays a very important role in daily human life as a crucial natural resource which safety standards must be met lest there be serious consequences towards citizens’ health. Contaminated water holds the potential to be the cause of dangerous disease. High numbers of diseases related to low water quality are increasingly becoming a serious concern. This situation is highly correlated to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) number six, which targets universal access towards clean water and sanitation. This research adopts Bayesian Data Analysis Method to analyze the factors that affect water potability in Indonesia. The purpose of this research is to contribute deep understanding about the relationship between variables which affects water potability (water quality). By increasing water potability, it’s hoped that there’s contribution to the achievement of SDG number three, that is “Good Health and Well-Being”. The data used is the “Water_Potability” dataset obtained from Kaggle which is quantitative. The dataset is analyzed using a logistic regression model with Bayesian analysis. The Bayesian Method is an approach where the combination from previous beliefs and current observed data can give a new belief regarding model parameters. The outcome of this research shows that the model couldn’t describe the factors that affect water quality.
